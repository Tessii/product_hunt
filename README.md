# product_hunt
Abstract from my university report: Product Hunt is powerful in marketing new digital products and features. Especially, being featured opens the door to potential partners, customers and investors. This paper focuses on understanding which features from the Product Hunt API can predict if a post will be featured. The objective is to leverage this data to increase a post's chances to be featured. Hence, the project is framed around the following research question: What aspects of a post should startups focus on to increase the likelihood to be featured? Since this project will serve as a foundation for future research in this area, a data infrastructure must be established. Thus, a data mart design based on an RDBMS is proposed. As a methodology for data processing, the CRISP-DM was chosen. The Data Analysis and Machine Learning revealed that the reviews rating is the most crucial feature. The project's findings can guide startups on how to effectively post on Product Hunt.
